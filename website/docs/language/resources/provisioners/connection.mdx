# Provisioner Connection Settings

Most provisioners require access to the remote resource via SSH or WinRM and
expect a nested `connection` block with details about how to connect.

-> **Note:** Provisioners should only be used as a last resort. There are better alternatives for most common situations. Refer to
[Declaring Provisioners](/language/resources/provisioners/syntax) for more details.

## Connection Block

You can create one or more `connection` blocks that describe how to access the remote resource. One use case for providing multiple connections is to have an initial provisioner connect as the `root` user to set up user accounts, and then have subsequent provisioners connect as a user with more limited permissions.

Connection blocks don't take a block label, and can be nested within either a
`resource` or a `provisioner`.

* A `connection` block nested directly within a `resource` affects all of
  that resource's provisioners.
* A `connection` block nested in a `provisioner` block only affects that
  provisioner, and overrides any resource-level connection settings.

Since the SSH connection type is most often used with
newly-created remote resources, validation of SSH host keys is disabled by
default. If this is not acceptable, you can establish a separate mechanism for key distribution and explicitly set the `host_key` argument (details below) to verify against a specific key or signing CA.

-> **Note:** In Terraform 0.11 and earlier, providers could set default values
for some connection settings, so that `connection` blocks could sometimes be
omitted. This feature was removed in 0.12 in order to make Terraform's behavior
more predictable.


### Example usage

```hcl
# Copies the file as the root user using SSH
provisioner "file" {
  source      = "conf/myapp.conf"
  destination = "/etc/myapp.conf"

  connection {
    type     = "ssh"
    user     = "root"
    password = "${var.root_password}"
    host     = "${var.host}"
  }
}

# Copies the file as the Administrator user using WinRM
provisioner "file" {
  source      = "conf/myapp.conf"
  destination = "C:/App/myapp.conf"

  connection {
    type     = "winrm"
    user     = "Administrator"
    password = "${var.admin_password}"
    host     = "${var.host}"
  }
}
```

## The `self` Object

Expressions in `connection` blocks cannot refer to their parent resource by
name. Instead, they can use the special `self` object.

The `self` object represents the connection's parent resource, and has all of
that resource's attributes. For example, use `self.public_ip` to reference an
`aws_instance`'s `public_ip` attribute.

Resource references are restricted because references create dependencies. Referring to a resource by name within its own block would create a dependency cycle.

## Argument Reference

| Argument Name | Supported By | Description | Default |
|---------------|--------------|-------------|---------|
|`type` | Both | The connection type that should be used. Valid types are `ssh` and `winrm`. | `ssh`|
|`user` | Both | The user to use for the connection. | `root` when using type `ssh`, `Administrator` when using type `winrm` |
|`password` | Both | The password we should use for the connection. In some cases this is specified by the provider. | |
| `host` | Both | **Required** - The address of the resource to connect to. | |
| `port` | Both| The port to connect to. | `22` when using type `ssh`,  `5985` when using type `winrm` |
| `timeout`| Both| The timeout to wait for the connection to become available. Should be provided as a string like `30s` or `5m`. | 5 minutes |
| `script_path` | Both | The path used to copy scripts meant for remote execution. |  |
| `private_key` | SSH | The contents of an SSH key to use for the connection. These can be loaded from a file on disk using [the `file` function](/language/functions/file). This takes preference over the password if provided. | |
| `certificate` | SSH | The contents of a signed CA Certificate. The certificate argument must be used in conjunction with a `private_key`. These can be loaded from a file on disk using the [the `file` function](/language/functions/file). | |
| `agent` | SSH | Set to `false` to disable using `ssh-agent` to authenticate. On Windows the only supported SSH authentication agent is [Pageant](http://the.earth.li/\~sgtatham/putty/0.66/htmldoc/Chapter9.html#pageant). |   |
| `agent_identity`| SSH | The preferred identity from the ssh agent for authentication. | |
| `host_key` | SSH | The public key from the remote host or the signing CA, used to verify the connection. | |
|`target_platform`| SSH | The target platform to connect to. Valid values are `windows` and `unix`. If the platform is set to `windows`, the default `script_path` is `c:\windows\temp\terraform_%RAND%.cmd`, assuming [the SSH default shell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_server_configuration#configuring-the-default-shell-for-openssh-in-windows) is `cmd.exe`. If the SSH default shell is PowerShell, set `script_path` to `"c:/windows/temp/terraform_%RAND%.ps1"` | `unix`|
|`https`| WinRM | Set to `true` to connect using HTTPS instead of HTTP. | |
|`insecure`| WinRM | Set to `true` to not validate the HTTPS certificate chain. | |
| `use_ntlm` | WinRM | Set to `true` to use NTLM authentication, rather than default (basic authentication), removing the requirement for basic authentication to be enabled within the target guest. Further reading for remote connection authentication can be found [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/winrm/authentication-for-remote-connections?redirectedfrom=MSDN). | |
|`cacert` | WinRM | The CA certificate to validate against. | |

## Connecting through a Bastion Host with SSH

The `ssh` connection also supports the following fields to facilitate connnections via a
[bastion host](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bastion_host).

| Argument Name | Description | Default |
|---------------|-------------|---------|
|`bastion_host`| Setting this enables the bastion Host connection. This host will be connected to first, and then the `host` connection will be made from there. | |
|`bastion_host_key`| The public key from the remote host or the signing CA, used to verify the host connection. | |
|`bastion_port` | The port to use connect to the bastion host. | The value of the `port` field|
|`bastion_user`| The user for the connection to the bastion host. | The value of the `user` field |
|`bastion_password` | The password to use for the bastion host. | The value of the `password` field |
|`bastion_private_key` | The contents of an SSH key file to use for the bastion host. These can be loaded from a file on disk using [the `file` function](language/functions/file). | The value of the `private_key` field |
| `bastion_certificate` |  The contents of a signed CA Certificate. The certificate argument must be used in conjunction with a `bastion_private_key`. These can be loaded from a file on disk using the [the `file` function](/language/functions/file). |
